Covid 19 cases and deaths in Taiwan 

The Epidemic Intelligence Center at Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control collects and disseminates data on COVID 19 cases in Taiwan by area, age, and gender (data source: https://data.cdc.gov.tw/en/dataset/aagstable-weekly-19cov). The labels of this dataset is in Chinese, and can benefit from translation and basic transformation to ease cross-national comparisons. I have completed this task for a larger project, which aims to harmonize global data from various sources by age for demographic or epidemiological research: https://github.com/timriffe/covid_age

For Taiwan's data, the following has been done: 
1. All labels and variables have been translated from Chinese to English.
2. Weeks have been matched to dates (with the first day of the week set as Monday) with WHO specification, with the source file for week/date provided by Taiwan's CDC. 
3. Taiwan so far has had 6 COVID 19 deaths (as of April 15, 2020), but the demographic characteristics of the deceased have not been publisbhed by Taiwan's CDC. These six cases have been entered manually into the data base, using various news sources.
